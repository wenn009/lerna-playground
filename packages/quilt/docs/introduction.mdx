# Introduction

Quilt is a _work in progress_ with the goal of eventually become Factual's design system for future applications.

Quilt is a product of collaboration between the Front and Design teams at Factual and _will eventually_ include all of the code, design tooling/assets, resources and guidelines for anyone to get started with using it. The goal is for it to serve and unify both designers and developers in the development of both internal and external applications while also being a resource that can be understood by others.

## Goals

Improved UX
By utilizing the same system and starting point for all projects, we hope to improve the consistency and quality of our UIs and unifying them under one consistent identity. Ingraining better UX practices into each individual component will also allow everyone to benefit from the research and learnings of others and past projects.

Efficiency
Collaboration between developers and designers is always top of mind. By sharing the same vocabulary and guidance around what we believe our best practices are, we can work better together with less hurdles and misunderstandings.

## Team

Quilt is developed together by select members of the Front, Design and Product Teams.
