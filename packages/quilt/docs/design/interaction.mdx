# Interaction

This is still a WIP...

## Buttons

Buttons make an action immediately visible and easy to perform in a single click.

### Which button type should I use?

<PrimaryButton>Action</PrimaryButton>
<SecondaryButton>Action</SecondaryButton>
<TertiaryButton>Cancel</TertiaryButton>

There are 4 main types of buttons - primary buttons, secondary buttons, tertiary buttons, and toggle buttons.

<PrimaryButton>Primary</PrimaryButton>

Primary Buttons are for **hefty** actions like adding to a design, building a design, or finishing a set.

There should only be one primary button in close proximity at any given time.

Primary buttons should be used sparingly, esp since they stand out so much visually! Don't want to clutter your design with unnecessary visual noise - makes it harder to navigate.

<SecondaryButton>Secondary</SecondaryButton>

Secondary buttons then are for mostly everything else - secondary actions, or actions where you don't want the button to stand out as much as a primary button.

In certain situations (normally when you don't want the button to take up too much space), you can use a no-border secondary.

<TertiaryButton>Tertiary</TertiaryButton>

Tertiary buttons are mainly for **undoing/going back**. Things like 'Cancel', 'Clear', etc.

<TertiaryButton>Toggle is WIP</TertiaryButton>

Toggle buttons are used to turn things on and off, or to show/hide. They're more like a checklist item in the sense that they're binary - it can be true or false.

### Examples in Context

TODO...

## Text Input

Text inputs allow people to enter information via typing.

### Which input type should I use?

Use a primary text input when the input can also serve as the section’s title, or as an important descriptor (ex: naming a design, a set, etc). These should be used sparingly.

This section is WIP

### What should the label and placeholder say?

A header should succinctly describe what information is contained within that section.

The label should describe what the text input is for. The placeholder should give a helpful example, display a call to action, or re-emphasize the label.

### Why should I use a label?

## Radio Input

Radio inputs allow users to choose between two or more options, where one of those options have to be ‘true’.

### When should I use a radio?

If there’s a field where one of the options has to be selected, but there are a few different options they can choose from.

### When should I Not Use A radio?

If there’s a field where the options don’t necessarily have to be selected.

If the field has multiple options, and all or none of them can be selected, use a checklist instead.

If the field has multiple options, and one has to be selected, but there are a lot of options, use a dropdown instead.

If there’s a setting or feature that would be its own standalone section, or if you’re space constrained, you might be able to use a toggle group instead.
