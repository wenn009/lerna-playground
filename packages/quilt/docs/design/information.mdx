# Information

This is still a WIP...

## Headers

Headers are used to introduce/separate a group of content.

### Which header type should I use?

<Playground>
  <H1>Header</H1>
  <H2>Header</H2>
  <H3>Header</H3>
</Playground>

Use a large header when you want to group multiple sections.

<Playground>
  <H4>Set Info</H4>
  <H5>Points of Interest</H5>
  <H6>Geographies</H6>
</Playground>

Use a smaller sized header for most other things.

### What should a header say?

A header should succinctly describe what information is contained within that section.

## Labels

Labels are used to specifically describe an individual item.

### Which label type should I use?

<label>MajorLabel is WIP</label>

Use a large label when you want to group multiple sections.

<label>Set Info</label>
<label>Points of Interest</label>

Use a normal label for pretty much everything else.

### What should a label say?

A label should succinctly describe whatever it’s referring to.

### What about radio and checkbox inputs?

Functionally these are Labels, stylistically they look more like Text. This is because:

- rather than just being descriptors, these labels are also the main mouse target + informational item.
- Checklists and radios often appear in lists of many items.

Therefore, it’s important to make them both easy to read and click.

## Text

General purpose style used primarily for paragraph snippets, or anything involving reading.

<Text>Example text item or paragraph snippet.</Text>

## Description

Frequently used style for adding additional information about a particular item, section, or component.

## Metadata

Text style used to display additional, non critical information about a particular item, section, or component. A Paragraph or Description should be used before this is used.
